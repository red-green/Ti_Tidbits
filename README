A collection of programs for TI calculators

I am currently not providing any documentation, but if you want to, please submit a pull request or wiki page.

Note that some TI-84 programs are written in AXE.

My TI-84 broke, so i am not going to be continuing any work on those programs, but the others will be updated occasionally.
